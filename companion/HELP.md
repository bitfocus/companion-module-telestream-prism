## Actions

All actions accept variables. The tool-tip indicates valid inputs (numeric range or text strings).

Many actions require a scope to be defined, such as the application tile to perform the command. An incorrect scope selection (such as performing a lightning application command on a tile running eye pattern) will return an error from the unit.

Some actions require specific hardware models, or licensed software modules.
