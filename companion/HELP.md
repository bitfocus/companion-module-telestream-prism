## Actions

Most actions accept variables. The tool-tip will indicate valid inputs.

Many actions require a scope to be defined, such as the application tile to perform the command. An incorrect scope selection (such as performing a lightning application command on a tile running eye pattern) will not effect an action.

Some actions apply to specific hardware models, or for licesnced software modules.
